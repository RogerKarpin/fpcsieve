================================================================

0.2.4 Set thread priority for Windows


0.2.3 Parse integer arguments 3k as 3*2^10, 5b5 as 5*2^5, etc.
      Nk = N*2^10    NK = N*10^3
      Nm = N*2^20    NM = N*10^6
      Ng = N*2^30    NG = N*10^9
      Nt = N*2^40    NT = N*10^12
      Np = N*2^50    NP = N*10^15
      NbM = N*2^M    NeM = N*10^M      
      NBM = N*2^M    NEM = N*10^M      

      blocksize option in bytes instead of kilobytes.

      priority=none cancels any previous priority option.


0.2.2 Changes in tps/


0.2.1 Fixed --qmax option.


0.2.0 Reorganized the Sieve of Eratosthenes code so that a large block of
      candidates can be sieved and then broken up into smaller chunks for
      allocation by individual threads. A thread can be sieving one block of
      candidates while other threads allocate chunks from a different block.


0.1.1 Worked around a stack alignment bug in the MinGW32 _beginthreadex
      function.


0.1.0 Release fpsieve for testing.
